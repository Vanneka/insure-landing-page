## Hi There! ðŸ‘‹
This is my entry for the Frontend Mentor challenge

The task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

The images in the `/images` folder have been optimised for desktop and mobile versions.

The `style-guide.md` file, contains the information for the color palette and fonts.

**Yay!!!** ðŸš€
